## dotfiles @daby's sessions

This repo stores my dotfiles setting up my vim + tmux configs as well as my docker compose file running my server services`

1. clone repo where you want to store your dotfiles
2. clone recursively the submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1`
3. make the `make.sh` executable by running `chmod +x make.sh`
4. create the symlink automatically by running `.make.sh`
